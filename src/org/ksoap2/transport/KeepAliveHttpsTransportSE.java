 * KeepAliveHttpsTransport deals with the problems with the Android ssl libraries having trouble with certificates and
 * certificate authorities somehow messing up connecting/needing reconnects. Added as generic class for SE since it might
 * be useful in SE environments as well and can be used as an example to create your own transport implementations.
